# Predicting Bike Sharing Data
To build a basic Neural Network (NN) to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

Introduction
In this project, I built a neural network to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, I have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before moving to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. I also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.
